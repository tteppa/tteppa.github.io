When I come across something interesting that I want to remember, I write it down. Usually on pieces of paper that end up getting scrapped or lost. Sometimes on TeX documents that stay on my computer. The following are the purposes of this blog.
<ol>
    <li> the notes to stay on my computer <em> and online </em> (well, this part depends on GitHub Pages), and </li>
    <li> for others to be able to read the notes, if they're interested. </li>
</ol>
(The third purpose is for me to learn some of the basics of GitHub, HTML, etc.)
