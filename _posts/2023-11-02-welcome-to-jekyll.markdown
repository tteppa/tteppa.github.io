### Introduction

In multivariable calculus, one often takes directional derivatives of vector fields with respect to other vector fields. How can one do this on a manifold? $\nabla_X Y$

<!-- Need to use double backslash square bracket. Setting displayMath: [['\[', '\]']] in default.html 
correctly made it so that \[ and \] would delimit displayed math, but then it would read any square
brackets inside the delimiters as a delimiter itself. Of course, escaping didn't work.

\\[
R(X,Y)Z = [\nabla_X, \nabla_Y]Z - \nabla_{[X, Y]}Z.

CAN IGNORE, BUT LEAVING IT IN INCASE IT'S USEFUL

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
