Trying to get a blog thing going here so I can write math. Used Jekyll to set up the GitHub Pages blog and then added MathJax.

### TO-DO:
<ol>
    <li> Fix the square bracket delimiter issue. </li>
    <li> Implement definition/theorem/proof environments. </li>
    <li> Put some old writing up on this. </li>
</ol>
